# Vehicle Detection in Hazy Environment 

An innovative solution for Vehicle Detection in Foggy/Hazy Environments by integrating YOLO V4, a state-of-the-art object detection model, after effective defogging of images. This approach significantly enhanced visibility and accuracy in adverse weather conditions.

## Steps followed in the Project:
* It starts with a hazy image and estimates the airlight and transmission.
* The transmission is refined using contextual information.
* Haze is removed from the image to obtain a dehazed version.
* The dehazed image is then passed to a vehicle detector, which identifies vehicles in the image and draws bounding boxes around them.
